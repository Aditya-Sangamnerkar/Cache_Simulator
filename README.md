# Cache_Simulator
* Designed a C++-based cache and memory hierarchy simulator (trace-driven) using principles of object-oriented programming.
* Simulated various memory hierarchies with caches at L1 and L2 levels along with stream buffers to optimize cache performance.
* Examined the impact of cache size, associativity, block size, stream buffers, and cache hierarchies on the miss rate in a cache for a given memory trace.
* Analysed the impact of stream buffers on the reduction of miss rate for looping assignments comprising of load and store operations on contiguous memory locations.
